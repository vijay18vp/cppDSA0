# C++ Pointers Notes (Improved with Examples)

### ðŸ§  What are Pointers?

Pointers are **special variables** that store the **address of other variables** in memory.

Every variable in C++ is stored somewhere in memory, and that location has an **address** (usually represented in **hexadecimal** form).

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    cout << "Address of a: " << &a << endl;  // prints the address of variable a
    return 0;
}
```

### ðŸ”¹ Declaring a Pointer

Syntax:

```cpp
int* ptr = &a;  // pointer to int storing address of a
```

Here,

* `int*` â†’ declares a pointer to an integer.
* `&a` â†’ gives the address of variable `a`.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int* ptr = &a;  // pointer holds address of a

    cout << "Value of a: " << a << endl;
    cout << "Address of a: " << &a << endl;
    cout << "Pointer ptr stores: " << ptr << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Dereference Operator (`*`)

The dereference operator `*` is used to **access the value stored at a given address**.

Example:

```cpp
int a = 10;
int* ptr = &a;
cout << *ptr << endl;  // prints value of a (10)
```

This is equivalent to:

```cpp
cout << *(&a) << endl;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Null Pointer

A **null pointer** does not point to any memory location.

Example:

```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;  // pointer initialized with null
if (ptr == nullptr)
    cout << "Pointer is null" << endl;
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Pass by Reference using Pointers

Pointers allow you to modify variables outside the function by passing their address.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void increment(int* ptr) {
    (*ptr)++;  // dereference and increment value
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    increment(&num);  // pass address of num
    cout << num;  // Output: 6
}
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Pointers and Arrays

An array name acts like a pointer that points to the **first element** of the array.

Example:

```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
cout << arr << endl;       // prints address of arr[0]
cout << *arr << endl;      // prints value of arr[0] â†’ 1
cout << *(arr + 1) << endl; // prints value of arr[1] â†’ 2
```

> Note: `arr` is a constant pointer â€” you cannot make `arr` point somewhere else.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Pointer Arithmetic

You can perform arithmetic operations like increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) on pointers.

Example:

```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int* ptr = arr;

cout << ptr << endl;     // address of arr[0]
ptr++;
cout << ptr << endl;     // address of arr[1]
cout << *ptr << endl;    // value at arr[1] â†’ 20
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Pointer Comparison & Subtraction

You can **subtract** or **compare** two pointers **only if they point to elements of the same array**.

Example:

```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
int* p1 = &arr[0];
int* p2 = &arr[3];

cout << (p2 - p1) << endl;  // Output: 3 (distance between pointers)
cout << (p1 < p2) << endl;  // Output: 1 (true)
```

---
